## üîÑ Iterative Development Approach

Throughout all phases:
- Regular weekly progress reviews
- Bi-weekly integration testing
- Monthly security reviews
- User feedback incorporation when possible

This roadmap is designed to be flexible, allowing for:
- Adjustment of timelines based on progress
- Reprioritization of features as needed
- Learning and improvement throughout the process
- Incremental delivery of value

## üõ£Ô∏è Critical Path Components

1. **Connection System**
   - Basic P2P connectivity must be established early
   - VPN functionality is a core feature for MVP
   - Security must be integrated from the beginning

2. **Authentication System**
   - User identity and server validation are critical
   - Key management underpins all security features
   - Connection authorization must be robust

3. **Network Interface**
   - VPN functionality relies on proper networking
   - Virtual interfaces must work across platforms
   - Performance is critical for user experience

4. **Admin Management**
   - System observability is essential for troubleshooting
   - User management enables practical deployment
   - Server monitoring ensures system health
