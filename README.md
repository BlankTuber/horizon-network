## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Horizon is a secure peer-to-peer network gateway with three primary components:

- A central broker that manages server registration and client authentication
- Servers that provide network services including VPN functionality and LAN emulation
- Client applications that establish direct connections to servers

The system enables:

- P2P client-server connections
- Network functionality (VPN, LAN emulation for various applications)
- Secure authentication through personal keys
- Operation with intermittent broker availability
- Server verification and update mechanisms

## üîÑ **Connection Flow**

### Server Registration Process

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Administrator generates registration key in broker
   - Server operator inputs key during setup
   - Server generates encryption keypair
   - Server collects location and hardware identity information

2. **Registration**:
   - Server connects to broker registration endpoint
   - Server provides registration key, public key, and location data
   - Broker validates registration key
   - Broker extracts public IP from connection
   - Broker determines geolocation information
   - Broker generates verification secret
   - Broker registers server and returns verification secret

3. **Ongoing Communication**:
   - Server sends heartbeat every 30 seconds
   - Server includes signature using keypair encryption
   - Server reports capabilities, location, and version
   - Broker validates signature
   - Process monitor ensures server stays active

### Client Connection Process

1. **Authentication**:
   - Client provides personal key to broker
   - Broker validates key and identifies user
   - Broker registers device if needed

2. **Server Discovery**:
   - Client requests available server list
   - Broker returns servers with capabilities and locations
   - Client displays server locations visually
   - Client selects appropriate server

3. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Broker records connection intent
   - Client initiates direct P2P connection to server
   - Server accepts connection if authorized
   - Broker updates connection status
   - Client UI shows real-time connection status

4. **Active Connection**:
   - Server provides network services
   - Client uses VPN/LAN functionality
   - Client displays performance metrics
   - Both maintain security with keypair encryption

5. **Connection Termination**:
   - Graceful disconnection process
   - Server returns to available status
   - Broker records connection end
   - Client UI updates to show disconnected state

### Broker Unavailability Handling

1. **Server Behavior**:
   - If serving client: continue operation normally
   - If idle: enter standby mode with reconnection attempts
   - Process monitor ensures stability during broker outage

2. **Client Behavior**:
   - Maintain current connection if active
   - Display appropriate status in UI
   - Cannot establish new connections during broker unavailability

### Key Management

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - System generates new keys when needed
   - Client receives key update notification
   - Automatic transition to new key

2. **Manual Updates**:
   - Administrator initiates key revocation
   - Previous key invalidated
   - User receives notification with instructions
   - User must manually input new key
