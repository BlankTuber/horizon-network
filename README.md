## üöÄ **Project Overview**

Horizon is a secure peer-to-peer network gateway with three primary components:
- A central broker that manages server registration and client authentication
- Servers that provide network services including VPN functionality and LAN emulation
- Client applications that establish direct connections to servers

The system enables:
- P2P client-server connections
- Network functionality (VPN, LAN emulation for gaming, geo-restriction bypass)
- Secure authentication through personal keys
- Operation with intermittent broker availability

## üîÑ **Connection Flow**

### Server Registration Process
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Administrator generates one-time registration key in broker
   - Administrator provides key to server operator
   - Server operator inputs key during initial setup
   - Server generates encryption keypair

2. **First-Time Registration**:
   - Server connects to broker registration endpoint
   - Server provides one-time registration key and public key
   - Broker validates registration key
   - Broker extracts public IP from connection
   - Broker binds registration key to server's public key
   - Broker generates verification secret for future authentication
   - Broker registers server and returns verification secret
   - Server stores verification secret securely

3. **Ongoing Communication & Verification**:
   - Server sends heartbeat every 30 seconds
   - Server includes HMAC signature using verification secret
   - Server reports capabilities and version
   - Broker validates HMAC signature
   - Broker periodically issues new challenges during heartbeats
   - Server responds to challenges using verification secret
   - Broker tracks last-seen and last-verified timestamps
   - Broker updates server status

### Client Connection Process
1. **Authentication**:
   - Client provides personal key to broker
   - Broker validates key
   - Broker recognizes device if previously used
   - Broker registers new device if first connection

2. **Server Discovery**:
   - Client requests available server list
   - Broker returns servers with capabilities
   - Client selects appropriate server
   - Client requests connection permission

3. **Connection Establishment**:
   - Broker records connection intent
   - Broker notifies server of pending connection
   - Client initiates direct P2P connection to server
   - Server accepts connection if authorized
   - Broker updates connection status

4. **Active Connection**:
   - Server provides network services
   - Client uses VPN/LAN functionality
   - Both track 8-hour time limit
   - Broker periodically verifies connection status

5. **Connection Termination**:
   - Time limit reached or user initiated
   - Graceful disconnection process
   - Server returns to available status
   - Broker records connection end

### Broker Unavailability Handling
1. **Server Behavior**:
   - If serving client: continue operation normally
   - If idle: enter standby mode with periodic broker reconnection attempts
   - Handle broker unavailability gracefully without crashing
   - Store last known good state for recovery
   - Resume normal operation when broker returns online

2. **Client Behavior**:
   - Maintain current connection if active
   - Attempt connection to cached servers if needed
   - Continue broker reconnection attempts
   - Store connection history locally

### Multi-Device Management
1. **Same-User Authentication**:
   - All devices use identical personal key
   - Broker identifies devices by hardware fingerprint
   - Connection history tracked per device

2. **Concurrent Connection Handling**:
   - Broker detects connection from new device
   - If existing connection present:
     - Prompt user for action
     - Terminate previous connection if confirmed
     - Establish new connection
     - Log device transition
